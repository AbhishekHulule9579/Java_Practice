************ Thread Join *****************

if your thread wants to wait until completing some other thread then we should go for join method

*for example ,if your thread t1 wants to wait until completing t2 then t1 has to call t2.join() .
if t1 execute t2.join then immediately t1 will be entered into waiting states until t2 completes .
once t2 complete then t1 can continue it's execution

Join way to announce

1)public void join()     --->Thrown Interrupted Exception
2)public void join(long millisecond)   -->Thrown Interrupted Exception
3)public void join(long millisecond,int macrosecond)    --->Thrown InterruptedException

** Note- Every join method throws Interrupted Exception which is checked exception ,hence compulsory we should handle
 this exception either by using try catch or throws exception otherwise we will get compile time error

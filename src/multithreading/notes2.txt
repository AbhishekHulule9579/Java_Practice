**************** Defining the thread by the runnable interface **************************
* 1st approach of the thread =-->mythread -->Thread-->Runnable(Interface)
* 2nd approach of the thread =--> myRunnable-->Runnable(Interface)

Runnable interface present in Java.lang package, and it contains only one method -->Run() method  [public void run()]


**************- case study *****************************

class myRunnable implements Runnable{
    public void run(){
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
public class T8_MyRunnable_Interface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        myRunnable r=new myRunnable();
        Thread t1=new Thread(r);
        Thread t2=new Thread(r);

cases-
1)case 1 - t1.start();
 A new thread will be created which is responsible for the execution of the thread class run method,which has
 empty implementation

2)case 2 - t1.run();
 No new thread will be created and the thread class run method will be executed just like the normal
 method call.

3)case 3 - t2.start();
 A new thread will be created which is responsible for the execution of myRunnable class run method

4)case 4 - t2.run();
 A new thread won't be created and the myRunnable run method will be executed just like a normal method call

5)case 5 - r.start();
 we will get compile time error saying "myRunnable doesn't have start capability"
 "Compile time error - cannot find the symbol"  , symbol:method start() , location - class myRunnable

6)case 6 - r.run():
 no new thread will be created and the myRunnable run method will be executed like normal method call

 *********************************************************************************************************************
from the 2 approach of the thread creation -
1)by extending the thread class
2)by implementing the runnable interface

Among 2 ways of the defining the thread implement runnable approach is recommended
Reasons- [we use approach 2 most reasons]=
1)   a)in the first [1st] approach our class always extend thread class,there is no chance of extending any other class
    hence we are missing the inheritance benefit
    b) but in the second [2nd] approach by implementing runnable interface we can extend any other class
    hence we won't miss any benefit of the inheritance
    **because of the above reason implementing runnable interface approach is recommended than extending the thread
    class

*****the second approach is most used  because for approach 1 we are extending the thread class, and therefore
we are unable to extends the another parent class (Inheritance).
and for the 2nd approach we can extend the parent class ******

**************Thread class constructor ************
1)Thread t=new Thread();
2)Thread t=new Thread(Runnable r);
3)Thread t=new Thread(String name);
4)Thread t=new Thread(Runnable r,String name);
5)Thread t=new Thread(ThreadGroup g,String name);
6)Thread t=new Thread(ThreadGroup g,Runnable r);
7)Thread t=new Thread(ThreadGroup g,Runnable r,String name);
8)Thread t=new Thread(ThreadGroup g,Runnable r,String name,long StackSize);

****** 3rd Approach to use the Thread **************
Note-Not recommended to use this approach

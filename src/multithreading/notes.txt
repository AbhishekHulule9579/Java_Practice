Multithreading =Executing multiple tasks simultaneously is known as the multithreading.

1)process based multitasking=executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is
                            separate independent process is known as the process based multitasking.
e.g -1) listening the song on the computer
      2)doing calculation on the same machine
      3)doing the coding at the same time
* process are the heavyweight task that required their own separate address space
* it is independent of each other
*process based multitasking is the best suitable for OS level

2)Thread based multitasking= executing several task simultaneously where is task is
                            separate independent part of same program

* Thread = thread is the smallest unit of dispatchable code

to develop the web server and appliction servers there we can use multithreading

*******Ways to create the thread ******************

1)By extending thread class
2)By implementing runnable interface

************* case 3 - importance of thread class start method **************

-->thread class start method is responsible to register with the thread schedular and all other mandatory
activities,hence without executing thread class start there is no chance of starting a new thread in java
due to this thread class start method is considered as heart of multithreading

start(){
1).Register this thread with thread schedular
2).perform all other mandatory activities
3).invoke run()
}

**************** case 4 -Overloading of the run method *************

overloading of run method is always possible but thread class start method can invoke no-argument run method
the other overloaded method we have call explicit like a normal method call

for reference -code --- T3_No_Thread_Calling.java

***************** case 5 - if we are not overriding run method *******************

it is highly recommended to override run method otherwise don't go for multithreading concept

**for reference code -- T4_Not_Overriding_run_Method

******************* case 6 - overriding of start method *********

if we override start method then our start method will be executed just like the normal method call
and the new thread won't be created

**for reference code -- T5_Overriding_Run_Method


Note -- it is not recommended to override start method otherwise don't go for multithreading concept

***************** case 7 - super method in the thread class **************

we can run the all thread in the particular class

for reference code - T6_Overriding_Run_Method_2

******************* case 8- thread Lifecycle ***************************

mythread t=new mythread();      **t.start();**               *thread start allocate process *               *if run method
***new/Born**           ---------------------------->Ready/---------------------------------------> Running -------------------->Dead
                                                    Runnable                                                *completed*

*****************case 9 - restarting the same thread again ***********************

after starting the thread if we are trying to restart the same thread then we will get run time exception saying
illegal thread exception

For reference code -- T7_Restarting_the_same_exception_again

/*Output
* Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException*/

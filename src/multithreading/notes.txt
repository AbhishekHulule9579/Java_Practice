Multithreading =Executing multiple tasks simultaneously is known as the multithreading.

1)process based multitasking=executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is
                            separate independant process is known as the process based multitasking.
e.g -1) listening the song on the computer
      2)doing calculation on the same machine
      3)doing the coding at the same time
* process are the heavyweight task that required their own separate address space
* it is independent of each other
*process based multitasking is best suitable for OS level

2)Thread based multitasking= executing several task simultaneously where is task is
                            separate independent part of same program

* Thread = thread is the smallest unit of dispatchable code

to develop the web server and appliction servers there we can use multithreading

*******Ways to create the thread ******************
1)By extending thread class
2)By implementing runnable interface

*************case 3 - importance of thread class start method**************
-->thread class start method is responsible to register with the thread shredular and all other mandatory
activities,hence without executing thread class start there is no chance of starting a new thread in java
due to this thread class start method is considered as heart of multithreading

start(){
1).Register this thread with thread schedular
2).perform all other mandatory activities
3).invoke run()
}

***     Synchronization ****

* if very few line of the code required synchronization then it is not recommend to declare entire method as
synchronized we have to enclose those few line of the code by using synchronized block

* the main advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is it reduces waiting time of threads and
improves performance of the system/application

* we can declared synchronized block as follows :
1)To get lock of current object
synchronized (this){
  *****
  *****
  // of the thread got the lock of the current object then only it is allowed execute this area.
}
2)to get lock of particular object
synchronized (b){
  ******
  ******
  // of the thread got the lock of the particular object b then only it is allowed to execute this area.
}

3)to get class level lock
synchronized (display.class){
  ******
  ******
  //of the thread got the class level lock of display then only it is allowed to execute this area.
}

* if there is the synchronization present, and we call this method then all other method will be stopped until the
 thread containg the synchronized is executed

** lock concept applicable for object type and class types but not for primitives , hence we can't pass
primitive argument to synchronized block otherwise we will get compile time error saying unexpected type
found in the required reference

FaQ s -->
1)what is synchronized keyword and where we can apply?
-->synchronized is the modifier applicable for methods class but not for variable.

2)explain advantage of synchronized keyword?
--> we can resolve data inconsistency problem

3)disadvantage of the synchronized keyword
-->it increases waiting time of thread and create performance time of thread

4)what is the race condition?
--> if multiple thread operating simultaneously on same java object then there may be the problem of
data inconsistency  == race condition

5)how we can resolve race condition ?
--> by using the synchronized

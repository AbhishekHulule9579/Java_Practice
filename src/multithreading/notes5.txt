************ Thread Join *****************

if your thread wants to wait until completing some other thread then we should go for join method

*for example ,if your thread t1 wants to wait until completing t2 then t1 has to call t2.join() .
if t1 execute t2.join then immediately t1 will be entered into waiting states until t2 completes .
once t2 complete then t1 can continue it's execution

Join way to announce

1)public void join()     --->Thrown Interrupted Exception
2)public void join(long millisecond)   -->Thrown Interrupted Exception
3)public void join(long millisecond,int macrosecond)    --->Thrown InterruptedException

** Note- Every join method throws Interrupted Exception which is checked exception ,hence compulsory we should handle
 this exception either by using try catch or throws exception otherwise we will get compile time error

** for reference -->T15_Thread_Join_Demo

case 3 - if main thread calls join method on child thread object and child thread calls join method on the
main thread object then both threads will wait forever and the program will be strucked (this is something like deadlock)

case 4 - if your threads calls join method on the same thread itself then the program will be strucked (this is something
like deadlock)  ,in this case thread has to wait infinite amount of time

*****************Thread Sleep *************************
if your thread don't want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time then we should go for sleep
method

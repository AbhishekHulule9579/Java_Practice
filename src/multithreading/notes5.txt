************ Thread Join *****************

if your thread wants to wait until completing some other thread then we should go for join method

*for example ,if your thread t1 wants to wait until completing t2 then t1 has to call t2.join() .
if t1 execute t2.join then immediately t1 will be entered into waiting states until t2 completes .
once t2 complete then t1 can continue it's execution

Join way to announce

1)public void join()     --->Thrown Interrupted Exception
2)public void join(long millisecond)   -->Thrown Interrupted Exception
3)public void join(long millisecond,int macrosecond)    --->Thrown InterruptedException

** Note- Every join method throws Interrupted Exception which is checked exception ,hence compulsory we should handle
 this exception either by using try catch or throws exception otherwise we will get compile time error

** for reference -->T15_Thread_Join_Demo

case 3 - if main thread calls join method on child thread object and child thread calls join method on the
main thread object then both threads will wait forever and the program will be strucked (this is something like deadlock)

case 4 - if your threads calls join method on the same thread itself then the program will be strucked (this is something
like deadlock)  ,in this case thread has to wait infinite amount of time

**referece --->T16_Thread_Dead


*****************Thread Sleep *************************
if your thread don't want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time then we should go for sleep
method

** 2 ways of the sleep method declaration**
1)public static native void sleep(long millsecond)            -->throws Interupted Exception    //not implemented in java
2)public static void sleep(long millesecond,int nanosecond)   -->throws Interupted Exception

Note = every sleep method throws Interrupted Exception, which is checked exception ,hence whenever we are using
sleep method compulsory we should handle Interrupted Exception either by try catch or by throws keywords otherwise
we will get compile time error

** for reference - T17_Thread_Sleep_1

** A thread can interrupt a sleeping thread or waiting thread by using interrupt method of the thread class---
-->public void interrupt()

** for reference --> T18_Thread_Sleep_2

**Note - whenever we are calling interrupt method if the target thread not in sleeping state or waiting state
then  there is no impact of interrupt call immediately interrupt call will be waited until target thread entered into
sleeping or waiting state if the target thread entered in the sleeping or waiting state then immediately interupt
call will interrupt the target thread.

if the target thread never entered into sleeping or waiting state i it's lifetime then there is no impact of
interrupt call this is the only case where interrupt call will be wasted .

******************** Thread Priority ****************************
Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY =10

every thread in java has some priority it may be default priority generated by JVM or custom
priority provided by programmer
the valid rang of thread priority is 1 to 10 ,where 1 is min priority and 10 is max priority

Thread class defines the following constant to represent some standard Priority =
1)Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1
2)Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5
3)Thread.MAX_PRIORITY =10

thread class defines the following method to get and set priority of the thread :--

1)public final int getPriority()

2)public final void setPriority(int p) -->int p ==allowed the to set the priority from 1 to 10
                                        otherwise Runtime error of Illegal Runtime Exception
ex.   1)t.setPriority(7); --> valid
       2)t.setPriority(17); -->not valid

 *****Default priority *****
 The default priority only for main thread is 5
 but for remaining thread priority will be inherited from the parent thread i.e. what ever priority parent thread
 has the same priority the same priority will be there for the child thread

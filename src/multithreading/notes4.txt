************* Yield Method ***********
yield method causes to pass current executing thread to give the chance for the waiting thread
of same priority ,if there is no waiting thread or all waiting thread have low priority then same thread
can continue it's execution

*if multiple thread are waiting with the same priority then ,which waiting thread will get chance --> we can't
expect it's depend on the thread schedular

*the thread which is yielded ,when will it get chance once again it depends on Thread schedular, and we can't except exactly

*yield method causes to pass current executing thread to give the chance to the same priority
*the thread which is yielded we can't when will it run it totally depends on the thread schedular

**** complete prototype of the yield method ****
public static native void yield()

******thread lifecycle if there is the yield method ****************
